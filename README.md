Automatic Number Plate Recognition using using Contours and Convolution Neural Networks (CNN)
In this project notebook, we show the overall implementation of License Plate Detection using the Contour method.
The contours are a useful tool for shape analysis and object detection and recognition. Using contour detection, we can detect the borders of objects, and therefore, localize them easily. Importantly, contour detection could be the very first step for many interesting applications such as image foreground extraction, simple image segmentation, detection and recognition.
